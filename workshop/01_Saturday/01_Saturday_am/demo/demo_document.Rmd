This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library("ggplot2")
gap.in <- read.delim("../data/gapminderDataFiveYear.txt", header = TRUE)
```

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(gap.in)
```

You can also do dynamic caluclations within prose text.  For example, we can calculate the maximum life expectancy of the United States (form this data set). It is `r max(gap.in$lifeExp[gap.in$country=="United States"])`. This can be useful so that you don't have to recalculate all your number if you update your data or change things after you have written the first draft.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(data = gap.in, aes(year, lifeExp)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + facet_grid(. ~ continent) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
```

### Shell lesson
This directory contains a script called `gapSplitter` which splits the gap minder file into unique country-year.txt 
files. These files are then moved into a directory corresponding to the year of the data.

For the lesson, ultimately, the students will reassemble all of the files back into one file. 
Over the course of the lesson, these disparate files will be used to teach different tasks and for challenges.
I'm on the fence, but I'm thinking of using awk to print data.

The intent is to give the `gapSplitter` script to the students *after the bootcamp* so they can practice with the same files.
I realize there is a little magic in that command, but I hope to give enough information to point eager students in the right
direction.

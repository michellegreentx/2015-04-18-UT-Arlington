#### Key Points
*   A local Git repository can be connected to one or more remote repositories.
*   Use the HTTPS protocol to connect to remote repositories until you have learned how to set up SSH.
*   `git push` copies changes from a local repository to a remote repository.
*   `git pull` copies changes from a remote repository to a local repository.
*   `git clone` copies a remote repository to create a local repository with a remote called `origin` automatically set up.

<div class="challenge" markdown="1">
Create a repository on GitHub,
clone it,
add a file,
push those changes to GitHub,
and then look at the [timestamp](../../gloss.html#timestamp) of the change on GitHub.
How does GitHub record times, and why?
